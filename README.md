Briscola
**************
Briscola is one of Italy's most popular card game. Briscola is a trick-taking game, meaning that each player puts one card in succession, with the player putting out the higher point-value winning the round (trick). Points are awarerd on the basis of the cards involved in the hand. The winner of the hand then goes on to lead the next round, meaning that he puts out his or her card first. When all the cards are played, players sum the points from cards in their "scoring piles" that were accumulated by taking tricks and the player with the higher points wins. After the deck is shuffled, each player is dealt three cards. The next card is placed face up on the playing surface, and the remaining deck is placed face down, sometimes covering half of the up-turned card. This card is the Briscola, and represents the trump suit for the game, i.e. the suit which always takes all other cards, card ranking notwithstanding.
